# Intervals.icu MCP Server

A Home Assistant addon that connects your [intervals.icu](https://intervals.icu) training data to Claude AI via the [Model Context Protocol (MCP)](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/). Ask Claude to review your training, and it pulls your real fitness data — activities, HRV, sleep, CTL/ATL/TSB — to give you a personalised coaching response.

## What it does

- **MCP endpoint** — expose your training data to Claude.ai or Claude Desktop as MCP tools
- **`review_training`** — Claude fetches 28 days of activities, 14 days of wellness, and your fitness metrics on demand
- **`update_workout`** — Claude can reschedule or modify planned workouts directly in your calendar
- **`delete_workout`** — Claude can remove planned workouts when rest is needed
- **Webhook receiver** — receive real-time events from intervals.icu (activity uploaded, analyzed, calendar updated) and push them to Home Assistant as events and mobile notifications
- **`/coach` endpoint** — trigger an automated coaching review via HTTP (e.g. from an HA automation)

## How it works

```
Claude.ai ──MCP──► /mcp ──► intervals.icu API
                              └─► HRV / sleep / wellness
                              └─► Activities / CTL / ATL / TSB
                              └─► Planned workouts

intervals.icu ──webhook──► /webhook ──► HA events + mobile push
```

When you ask Claude "review my training", it calls `review_training`, gets your data, and responds using the Recovery Index (RI) and ACWR load metrics to assess readiness and suggest adjustments.
